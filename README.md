# 2017 Countdown Timer

1. **Time taken**
  - about 45 minutes

2. **Tools used**
  - Vanilla JavaScript, HTML/CSS
  - For more complex applications, tools and frameworks like jQuery and Bootstrap might have been helpful. But for a simple timer like this, I felt that heavy assets would unnecessarily slow down the page load speed.

3. **Bug Fixes / improvements**
  - Displaying the days or months may be more helpful for readability
  - More styling
